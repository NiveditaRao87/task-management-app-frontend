You should be able to add lists, and add cards to list. Try to make it remind you of sticky notes. With option to choose colour like in google keep, use pastels so there isn't much contrast in the backgrounds of the cards.
Next steps - handle add card, add list, then stop and fix the css, add background etc.
on clicking a card, bigger view should open on new window
handle adding settings first to card - such as adding a description, a due date, adding a timer to track time spent on it
Drag and drop to move card. Stop and fix CSS
Stop and add backend
Open calendar option in card to show the time spent on that task
Then activity tracker.... random thoughts, not all needs to be a part of the first version.

Observations - it is a little verbose to keep lifting state up, I find that i keep on adding more and more props and soon the code might become too difficult to read. 

Things done so far created lists, and card components,  handled adding of cards, simple css is done temporarily, 
Time spent in thinking what I want to do and development - 4 hours
Refactor the code so that a single form is used for both add card and add lists, now use it to add list form, maybe refactor button to do the same, add background image
Apply newly learnt react fragment knowledge maybe to say make css flex work better?
also useReducer or Redux
